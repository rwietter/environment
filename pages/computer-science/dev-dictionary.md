# Developer Dictionary

- Abstraction: The process of hiding the implementation details of a function or class from the user. This is done by providing a simple interface to the user, which can be used to perform the desired task. The user does not need to know how the function or class works internally. This is done to reduce the complexity of the program and make it easier to understand.
- Algorithm: A set of instructions to solve a problem.
- API: Application Programming Interface. A set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
- Array: A collection of elements of the same type. The elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. The first element of the array is stored at the lowest address. The last element is stored at the highest address.
- Asynchronous: A programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is not dependent on the completion of a function. The program continues to execute even if the function has not returned a value.
- Big O Notation: A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
- Deadline: The time by which a task must be completed.
- Data Structure: A way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
- Debugging: The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.
- Dependency: A relationship between two or more objects where one object is dependent on the other object.
- Binary Search: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.
- Bit: A binary digit. It can have only two possible values: 0 or 1.
- Bitwise: Relating to or using bits.
- Bitwise AND: A bitwise operator that performs a logical AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments. The result of the AND is 1 if and only if both bits are 1.
- Bitwise OR: A bitwise operator that performs a logical OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. The result of the OR is 1 if either bit of the two integers is 1.
- Bitwise XOR: A bitwise operator that performs a logical exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. The result of the XOR is 1 if and only if the corresponding bits of the two integers are different.
- Bitwise NOT: A bitwise operator that performs a logical negation on each bit of its integer argument. The result of the NOT is 1 if and only if the bit is 0.
- Software: A set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a specific task.
- Architecture: The structure or organization of a system. It is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.
- Artificial Intelligence: The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
- Compiler: A computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code.
- Interpreter: A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
- AST: Abstract Syntax Tree. A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.
- ELF: Executable and Linkable Format. A common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. It is the main format used on Unix-like operating systems.
- IR: Intermediate Representation. A representation of the source code of a program that is easier for a compiler to process than the source code itself. It is usually an abstract syntax tree.
- JIT: Just-In-Time. A compilation strategy in which the source code is compiled into machine code at runtime. This is done to improve the performance of the program.
- AOT: Ahead-Of-Time. A compilation strategy in which the source code is compiled into machine code before the program is executed. This is done to improve the performance of the program.
- Bytecode: A sequence of instructions that can be executed by a virtual machine. It is usually generated by a compiler from a higher-level programming language.
- Bit: A binary digit. It can have only two possible values: 0 or 1. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer.
- Byte: A unit of data that typically consists of eight bits. It is the smallest addressable unit of memory in a computer.
- JVM: Java Virtual Machine. A virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.
